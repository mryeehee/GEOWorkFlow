# Chrome Web Store listing draft

## Name

GEOWorkFlow Chrome Operator

## Short description

Claim GEOWorkFlow publishing work and safely fill drafts in websites where you are already signed in.

## Detailed description

GEOWorkFlow Chrome Operator gives content operations teams a controlled bridge between self-hosted GEOWorkFlow work orders and a user's existing Chrome session.

Operators can review assigned work, claim one work order, open its target page, copy content, and return a completion receipt. The included Zhihu answer adapter verifies the expected profile before filling plain text into an empty answer editor. The operator remains responsible for reviewing the draft and clicking the platform's final Publish button.

The extension requests website access only when the user connects a GEOWorkFlow instance or opens a target platform. It does not collect platform credentials, cookies, page bodies, or browsing history.

## Permission justification

- `sidePanel`: provides a persistent work queue next to the target page.
- `storage`: stores the scoped GEOWorkFlow connection and current task state.
- `scripting`: runs a packaged adapter after the operator requests draft filling.
- `activeTab`: limits page interaction to the operator's active workflow.
- Optional host access: requested for the configured GEOWorkFlow instance and each target platform origin.
